Issue with the program in incrementing PC for the final command. Most likely caused by how I am executing/fetching around line 89. I had removed the incrementing to the PC from halt instructions because it was being read several times for some reason which would cause the rest of the program to not function properly, so I don't know how to account for when I reach the end of the instructions.
